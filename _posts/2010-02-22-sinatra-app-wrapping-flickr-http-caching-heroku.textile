title: A Sinatra App Wrapping Flickr, HTTP Caching and Heroku
---

In the last several months, "Esther":http://www.estherswhite.net has produced a large quantity of monotype prints at a local printmaking studio. She's been scanning her work and posting it to Flickr. Recently she experimented with using Tumblr to create a stylish gallery of this work. But this process &mdash; scanning, adding metadata (title, medium, size), uploading to Flickr, followed by posting each piece to Tumblr &mdash; proved to be laborious. So we sought to streamline this workflow, hoping to eliminate a step or two.

Titles, descriptions, tags and sets are all easy to manage on Flickr. What if there was a way to leverage an image's metadata on Flickr in a separate gallery? I attempted to solve this problem with a "Sinatra application that wraps the Flickr API in a warm embrace":http://github.com/akahn/recent-work.estherswhite.net. The app makes an API request to Flickr asking for all the images from Esther's "printmaking photoset":http://www.flickr.com/photos/estherswhite/sets/72157622782141504/ and renders them as thumbnails, each image linking to a page for that image. On the individual image page, the app requests information on an image &ndash; title, description, and the next and previous image &ndash; and displays this information along with a larger image of the piece. This means no more managing the art in two places (Flickr and Tumblr)! Now, Flickr itself is the CMS, with the gallery taking advantage of information already stored on Flickr.

What about performance? Isn't it slow to make an API request to Flickr for every visit to the site? This is a definite concern: making an API call to Flickr and then responding takes the application about 500ms &ndash; respectable but not exactly speedy. But the content of the site is basically static. Once an image is uploaded and described on Flickr, it is unlikely to change. This means I can cache the entire page with a gateway cache<sup>1</sup>. To do this, I set @Cache-Control@ headers that say that my pages are allowed to be cached for long time, and the cache, Varnish, serves up a static representation of the page that the Sinatra app produced. This means that once a page has been requested once, subsequent requests for that page are lightning-fast &ndash; under 100ms. After six hours, the cached representation of the hompage is considered stale. After two days, the cached representation of an individual page is considered stale. This way, updates to the photoset or changes to images do eventually get served to visitors.

I should note that I'm hosting this site on Heroku. It's been said many times elsewhere and should perhaps be obvious, but I'll say it again: Heroku is awesome. "Their use of Varnish":http://docs.heroku.com/http-caching made it so easy to make this gallery app fast. Deploying code with just a @git push@ is seriously great. I recommend hosting an app on Heroku if you haven't before.
